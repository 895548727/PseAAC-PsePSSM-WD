%%%%% Pseudo-position specific scoring matrix(PsePSSM)
%Use PsePSSM of Chou and Shen to extract the features of a protein sequence
%First, download the BLAST package locally at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/release/LATEST.
%Then, use the PSI-BLAST program to compare the imported submitochondrial protein sequences in FASTA format with the non-redundant protein database nr. download the nr package locally at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/nr. 
%Finally, select the number of amino acid residue intervals to get feature vectors.
